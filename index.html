          <h2>What is blood donation?</h2>
          <p>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and
            used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called
            fractionation (separation of whole-blood components).
            Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (the latter called apheresis).
            Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.</p>

          <h2>Who can donate blood?</h2>
          <p>Today in the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers
            who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries,
            established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when
            family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation).
            Many donors donate as an act of charity, but in countries that allow
            paid donation some donors are paid, and in some cases there are incentives
            other than money such as paid time off from work. Donors can also have blood
            drawn for their own future use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe,
            but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.</p>
          <p>Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use.
            The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a
            blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis.
            The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take
            a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous
            to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies from days
            to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country
            where the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors
            must wait eight weeks (56 days) between whole blood donations but only seven days
            between plateletpheresis donations and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis.[1]</p>

          <h2>Why do we need blood donation?</h2>
          <p>Giving blood saves lives. The blood you give is a lifeline in an emergency and for people who need long-term treatments.</p>
          <p>Many people would not be alive today if donors had not generously given their blood.</p>
          <p>What happens after your blood is taken? Your blood is sent to labs for rigorous testing,
            where approximately 12 tests are performed. After testing and once your blood is declared “safe” for transfusion,
            it is then transferred to hospitals and clinics in need. Depending on your blood type, your donation could be used in a variety of situations.
            People who have the blood type O-negative are universal donors, and their red blood cells can be transfused into anyone regardless of the recipient’s blood type.
            When doctors are in emergency situations and don’t have the time or capability to check the patient’s blood type, they will use O-negative blood.
            This means O-negative blood is always in high demand. Emergency situations are just some of the many instances blood transfusions are performed.
            Anemic patients often receive transfusions to increase their iron levels, while some people with sickle cell disease encounter complications and require a transfusion every month.
            Patients with long-term illnesses or battling cancer, premature infants, and patients undergoing open-heart surgeries may also be the recipient of your gift.</p>
