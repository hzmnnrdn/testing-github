      <h1>Fun Facts of Blood Donating</h1>
      <div class="isi">
        <h2>Donating Blood Is Good For Your Heart</h2>
        <p>Blood flow and blood volume is integral to keeping the heart beating.
          However, while it may sound counterintuitive, regularly donating blood can actually improve heart health, not compromise it.
          According to Blood Flow Online, donating blood regularly can help to reduce how thick and sticky your blood is, thus allowing blood to flow more easily through the blood vessels and reach the heart faster.</p>

        <h2>Donating Blood Lowers Your Cancer Risk</h2>
        <p>Donating blood can reduce the donor's risk of developing cancer.
          Iron, one of the main minerals found in blood, has been known to increase the amount of free-radical damage in the body.
          However, a 2008 study found that donating blood helps reduce iron stores, thus reducing overall individual cancer risk.</p>

        <h2>Could Justify Skipping A Workout</h2>
        <p>If saving the lives of others and improving your own personal health isn’t enough to get you to donate blood, how about the possible weight loss advantages.
          According to LiveStrong, you can burn about 650 calories per donation of one pint of blood —that's even more than what you burn in a 30 minute run!</p>

        <h2>One Man Saved 2 Million Babies Due To His Rare Blood</h2>
        <p>While it’s estimated that the average person can save about 1,000 lives in a lifetime due to donating blood, James Harrison was able to save around 2 million due to his rare blood type.
          Harrison’s blood contained high levels of an antibody known as anti-D immunoglobulin which was specifically used to help babies with a condition known as Rhesus disease.
          In short, the immune system of mothers carrying babies with Rhesus disease attacks the fetus. However, a transfusion of Harrison’s blood can prevent such an attack.</p>

        <h2>Coconut Water Can Be Used As Substitute In Emergency</h2>
        <p>According to ABC Science, in the case of an emergency, medical professionals can substitute coconut water as an alternative to plasma.
          Although the two are far from identical, coconut water has about one-fortieth the sodium level of plasma, while the potassium level is about 10-15 times higher.
          In the case where there is no IV available for a dehydrated patient, drinking coconut water will do.</p>

        <h2>Most Blood Goes To Cancer Patients</h2>
        <p>We may picture road-side trauma when we imagine where blood donations go, but in reality, only about 2 percent of all blood donations go to trauma patients.
          It’s actually cancer patients who receive the most blood.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="isi">
        <h2>Blood Shortages Happen Most During The Holidays</h2>
        <p>Everyone tends to get a bit busy over the holiday, and blood donation trends show this.
          According to the Community Blood Bank of Northwest Pennsylvania and Western New York, blood shortages happen most during summer and winter holidays,
          so this is when you should keep the practice in mind most.</p>

      <div class="isi">
        <h2>Someone Needs Blood Every Two Seconds In The U.S.</h2>
        <p>It’s hard to imagine just how important blood donations are, but according to the American Red Cross, someone in the U.S. is in need of blood every two seconds.
          Aside from those with cancer and trauma patients, blood donations are also used for surgeries, obstetrics, and patients with specific blood disorders.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="isi">
        <h2>Type O Positive Blood Is The Most Commonly Needed </h2>
        <p>Although all types of blood are needed and accepted, type O positive is the most needed. It's the most common blood type, so it's the most likely to be to transfused.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="isi">
        <h2>Only 10 Percent Of Eligible U.S. Population Donates Blood</h2>
        <p>According to New York Blood Center, anyone 17 years old, weighing at least 110 pounds, and who is in good health is eligible to donate blood, but fewer than 10 percent of the eligible population do so.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="isi">
        <h2>Eight percent of your body weight is in your blood.</h2>
        <p>Scientists have estimated the volume of blood in the human body to be eight percent of body weight, according to the American Society of Hematology.
          An average adult body with a weight of 150 to 180 pounds will contain about 1.2 to 1.5 gallons of blood.
          Meanwhile, an average child with a body weight of 80 pounds will have half the amount of blood as an adult.</p>

        <h2>There is 0.2 milligrams of gold in your body, most of which is in your blood.</h2>
        <p>The human body contains gold, but it’s not enough to strike it rich.
          The body contains approximately 0.2 milligrams of gold that is most diffused with our blood.
          However, you would need to bleed 40,000 people dry just to collect enough blood to make an 8-gram souvenir, The Telegraph reported.</p>

        <h2>Pregnant women have about 50% more blood by week 20 of pregnancy than they did before they conceived.</h2>
        <p>During pregnancy, a woman’s blood volume increases by 50 percent to help support the uterus, along with the amount of blood pumped by the heart.
          This extra volume is necessary to provide blood to the uterus and placenta, says All Children’s Hospital.
          By the end of the pregnancy, a woman’s uterus will receive one-fifth of her pre-pregnancy blood supply.</p>

        <h2> Your blood type can increase memory problems.</h2>
        <p>The life-sustaining liquid has more power over brain function than most like to think.
          A 2014 study published in the journal Neurology found those with blood type AB were twice as likely to experience memory problems as those with type O blood.
          However, AB patients shouldn't worry since the association made was relatively small and warrants further research to validate the claim.
          This blood type is also prone to blood clots and can lead to heart attacks, stroke, or other vein clogging due to its higher levels of protein VIII.</p>

        <h2>Green Bay Packers fan unknowingly treated fatal blood disease through blood donations to afford football games.</h2>
        <p>Jim Becker, a die-hard Green Bay Packers fan, used to donate blood to afford to buy tickets to the Packers games for 56 years, to discover he was saving his own life all along.
          The Packers fan was told by his doctor his blood donations may have dampened the effects of an undiagnosed case of hemochromatosis, a blood disorder that took his father's life, ABC News reported.
          The only treatment for hemochromatosis is to donate blood routinely, or about one unit of blood per week until iron levels are back to normal.</p>
