      <h1>Frequently Asked Question</h1>
      <div id="accordion">

          <h2 class="flip">How does the blood donation process work?</h2>
            <p class="panel">The process itself took around an hour from the moment you arrive until you leave. The donation process itself usually took 10 to 15 minutes. There are few steps for the process which are:
              <br>
            <b>Registration</b> <br>
              1. You have to complete the registration form where you will need to fill in particular information about yourself like name, address, phone number and identification number.
              <br>
            <b>Health History and Mini Physical</b> <br>
              1. You will answer some confidential questionaire regarding your health history. <br>
              2. You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.
              <br>
            <b>Donation</b> <br>
              1. We will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds. <br>
              2. When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.
              <br>
            <b>Refreshments</b> <br>
              1. Usually they will provide some refreshments for you. <br>
              2. After a few minutes taking the refreshments then you can leave.
          </p>



          <h2 class="flip">What i should do after donating blood?</h2>
          <p class="panel">After donating blood, take this <b>precautions:</b> <br>
            <b>-</b>Drink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids. <br>
            <b>-</b>Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting. <br>
            <b>-</b>If the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops. <br>
            <b>-</b>Because you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm. For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation. <br>
            <b>-</b>Eat healthy meals and consider adding iron-rich foods to your regular diet, or discuss taking an iron supplement with your health care provider, to replace the iron lost with blood donation. <br>
            <b>-</b>If you get a bruise:  Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days. <br>
            <b>-</b>If you get dizzy or lightheaded:  Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities. <br>
          </p>


          <h2 class="flip">Does it hurt when the needle being inserted?</h2>
          <p class="panel">Only for a moment. Pinch the fleshy, soft underside of your arm. That pinch is similar to what you will feel when the needle is inserted.</p>

          <h2 class="flip">How long does the blood donation process take?</h2>
          <p class="panel">The entire process takes about one hour and 15 minutes; the actual donation of a pint of whole blood unit takes eight to 10 minutes. However, the time varies slightly with each person depending on several factors including the donor’s health history and attendance at the blood drive.</p>

          <h2 class="flip">How long to replenish the blood i have donated?</h2>
          <p class="panel">The plasma from your donation is replaced within about 24 hours. Red cells need about four to six weeks for complete replacement. That’s why at least eight weeks are required between whole blood donations</p>

          <h2 class="flip">How frequent i can donate blood?</h2>
          <p class="panel">You must wait at least eight weeks (56 days) between donations of whole blood and 16 weeks (112 days) between Power Red donations. Platelet apheresis donors may give every 7 days up to 24 times per year. Regulations are different for those giving blood for themselves (autologous donors).</p>

          <h2 class="flip">Who can donate blood?</h2>
          <p class="panel">In most states, donors must be age 17 or older. Some states allow donation by 16-year-olds with a signed parental consent form. Donors must weigh at least 110 pounds and be in good health. Additional eligibility criteria apply.</p>

          <h2 class="flip">Can i donate blood if i take medications?</h2>
          <p class="panel">In almost all cases, medications will not disqualify you as a blood donor. Your eligibility will be based on the reason that the medication was prescribed. As long as the condition is under control and you are healthy, blood donation is usually permitted.</p>

          <h2 class="flip">Can pregnant women or nursing mother donate blood?</h2>
          <p class="panel">Persons who are pregnant are not eligible to donate. Wait 6 weeks after giving birth.</p>

          <h2 class="flip">Can i donate if i got Sexual Transmitted Disease?</h2>
          <p class="panel">Wait 12 months after treatment for syphilis or gonorrhea. <br>
            Acceptable if it has been more than 12 months since you completed treatment for syphilis or gonorrhea. <br>
            Chlamydia, venereal warts (human papilloma virus), or genital herpes are not a cause for deferral if you are feeling healthy and well and meet all other eligibility requirements.</p>

          <h2 class="flip">Can person with HIV/AIDS donate blood?</h2>
          <p class="panel">You should not give blood if you have AIDS or have ever had a positive HIV test, or if you have done something that puts you at risk for becoming infected with HIV.</p>
